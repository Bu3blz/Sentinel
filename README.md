## Description
```
The Sentinel Project is designed to assist security testers by providing various methods 
for subdomain discovery and analysis. The main goal of this project is to make the 
process of subdomain enumeration as easy as possible by automatically performing general 
analysis, testing for typical flaws, determining the subdomain's purpose, and generation
of a clean overview in form of a final report. The prefered scan options can be configured 
as needed. All subdomains and addresses are stored seperately for further processing.
```

## Quick Start

- `Windows`:
```

```

- `Linux`:
```bash
