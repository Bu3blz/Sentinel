## Description
```
The Sentinel Project is designed to assist security testers in the reconnaissance phase
by providing various methods for subdomain discovery and analysis. The main goal 
of this project is to make the process of subdomain enumeration as easy as possible 
by automatically performing general analysis, testing for typical flaws, 
determining the subdomain's purpose, and ensuring that all basic needs are met. All 
results will be sorted and saved for further processing.
```

## Overview

- ***Discover*** hidden subdomains using the preferred option
- ***Analyze*** each subdomain for common security flaws and more
- ***Filter*** all output as needed
- ***Categorize*** all results and store addresses seperately
- ***Generate*** a report automatically containing all test results and found subdomains

## Quick Start

- `Windows`:
```
.\build\Windows\build.bat
```

- `Linux`:
```bash
cmd="./build/Linux/build.sh";chmod +x $cmd && $cmd
```

- `Display` the available `options`:
